# Singleton

_**Singleton** lets you ensure that only one object of its kind exists,
while providing a global access point to this instance._

- [`how-to-create`](./how-to-create/) contains simple examples how to create
  an actual singleton object.
- [`logger`](./logger/) is a practical example of how the Rust logging
  subsystem is essentially implemented.
